                            Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product,
                            whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and
                            other devices as a metered service over a network (typically the Internet).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Cloud computing provides computation, software, data access, and storage resources
                            without requiring cloud users to know the location and other details of the computing
                            infrastructure.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            End users access cloud based applications through a web browser or a light weight
                            desktop or mobile app while the business software and data are stored on servers
                            at a remote location. Cloud application providers strive to give the same or better
                            service and performance as if the software programs were installed locally on end-user
                            computers.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of infrastructure convergence
                            (or Converged Infrastructure) and shared services. This type of data centre environment
                            allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with easier
                            manageability and less maintenance, and enables IT to more rapidly adjust IT resources
                            (such as servers, storage, and networking) to meet fluctuating and unpredictable
                            business demand.

                            Cloud computing shares characteristics with:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Autonomic computing — Computer systems capable of self-management.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Client–server model — Client–server computing refers broadly to any distributed
                            application that distinguishes between service providers (servers) and service requesters
                            (clients).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Grid computing — "A form of distributed and parallel computing, whereby a 'super
                            and virtual computer' is composed of a cluster of networked, loosely coupled computers
                            acting in concert to perform very large tasks."
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Mainframe computer — Powerful computers used mainly by large organizations for
                            critical applications, typically bulk data processing such as census, industry and
                            consumer statistics, police and secret intelligence services, enterprise resource
                            planning, and financial transaction processing.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Utility computing — The "packaging of computing resources, such as computation
                            and storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility, such
                            as electricity."
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Peer-to-peer — Distributed architecture without the need for central coordination,
                            with participants being at the same time both suppliers and consumers of resources
                            (in contrast to the traditional client–server model).
                            <br />

                            Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Empowerment</b> of end-users of computing resources by putting the provisioning
                            of those resources in their own control, as opposed to the control of a centralized
                            IT service (for example)
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Agility</b> improves with users' ability to re-provision technological infrastructure
                            resources.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Application programming interface (API)</b> accessibility to software that enables
                            machines to interact with cloud software in the same way the user interface facilitates
                            interaction between humans and computers. Cloud computing systems typically use
                            REST-based APIs.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Cost</b> is claimed to be reduced and in a public cloud delivery model capital
                            expenditure is converted to operational expenditure. This is purported to lower
                            barriers to entry, as infrastructure is typically provided by a third-party and
                            does not need to be purchased for one-time or infrequent intensive computing tasks.
                            Pricing on a utility computing basis is fine-grained with usage-based options and
                            fewer IT skills are required for implementation (in-house).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Device and location independence</b> enable users to access systems using a
                            web browser regardless of their location or what device they are using (e.g., PC,
                            mobile phone). As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party)
                            and accessed via the Internet, users can connect from anywhere.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Virtualization</b> technology allows servers and storage devices to be shared
                            and utilization be increased. Applications can be easily migrated from one physical
                            server to another.
                            <br />

                            •<b>Multi-tenancy</b> enables sharing of resources and costs across a large pool
                            of users thus allowing for:

                            Centralization of infrastructure in locations with lower costs (such as real estate,
                            electricity, etc.)
                            <br />

                            Peak-load capacity increases (users need not engineer for highest possible load-levels)
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Utilisation and efficiency improvements for systems that are often only 10–20% utilised.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            •<b>Reliability<b> is improved if multiple redundant sites are used, which makes well-designed
                                cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                •<b>Scalability<b> and Elasticity via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources
                                    on a fine-grained, self-service basis near real-time, without users having to engineer
                                    for peak loads.

                            Users access cloud computing using networked client devices, such as desktop computers,
                            laptops, tablets and smartphones. Some of these devices - cloud clients - rely on
                            cloud computing for all or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially
                            useless without it. Examples are thin clients and the browser-based Chromebook.
                            Many cloud applications do not require specific software on the client and instead
                            use a web browser to interact with the cloud application. With AJAX and HTML5 these
                            Web user interfaces can achieve a look and feel similar to, or even better than,
                            native applications. Some cloud applications, however, support specific client software
                            dedicated to these applications (e.g., virtual desktop clients and most email clients).
                            Some legacy applications (line of business applications that until now have been
                            prevalent in thin client Windows computing) are delivered via a screen-sharing technology.

                            Cloud application services or "Software as a Service (SaaS)" deliver software as
                            a service over the Internet, eliminating the need to install and run the application
                            on the customer's own computers and simplifying maintenance and support.

                                A cloud application is software provided as a service. It consists of the following:
                                a package of interrelated tasks, the definition of these tasks, and the configuration
                                files, which contain dynamic information about tasks at run-time. Cloud tasks provide
                                compute, storage, communication and management capabilities. Tasks can be cloned
                                into multiple virtual machines, and are accessible through application programmable
                                interfaces (API). Cloud applications are a kind of utility computing that can scale
                                out and in to match the workload demand. Cloud applications have a pricing model
                                that is based on different compute and storage usage, and tenancy metrics. </br>
                            What makes a cloud application different from other applications is its elasticity.
                            Cloud applications have the ability to scale out and in. This can be achieved by
                            cloning tasks in to multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet the changing work
                            demand. Configuration Data is where dynamic aspects of cloud application are determined
                            at run-time. There is no need to stop the running application or redeploy it in
                            order to modify or change the information in this file. </br>SOA is an umbrella
                            that describes any kind of service. A cloud application is a service. A cloud application
                            meta-model is a SOA model that conforms to the SOA meta-model. This makes cloud
                            applications SOA applications. However, SOA applications are not necessarily cloud
                            applications. A cloud application is a SOA application that runs under a specific
                            environment, which is the cloud computing environment (platform). This environment
                            is characterized by horizontal scalability, rapid provisioning, ease of access,
                            and flexible prices. While SOA is a business model that addresses the business process
                            management, cloud architecture addresses many technical details that are environment
                            specific, which makes it more a technical model.

                            Cloud platform services, also known as platform as a service (PaaS), deliver a computing
                            platform and/or solution stack as a service, often consuming cloud infrastructure
                            and sustaining cloud applications. It facilitates deployment of applications without
                            the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software
                            layers. Cloud computing is becoming a major change in the computing industry, and
                            one of the most important parts of this change is the shift of cloud platforms.
                            Platforms let developers write certain applications that can run in the cloud, or
                            even use services provided by the cloud. There are different names being used for
                            platforms which can include the on-demand platform, or Cloud 9. Regardless of the
                            nomenclature, they all have great potential in developing, and when development
                            teams create applications for the cloud, each must build its own cloud platform.

                            – as a service, along with raw (block) storage and networking. Rather than purchasing
                            servers, software, data-center space or network equipment, clients instead buy those
                            resources as a fully outsourced service. Suppliers typically bill such services
                            on a utility computing basis; the amount of resources consumed (and therefore the
                            cost) will typically reflect the level of activity.

                            public over the Internet. Public cloud services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage
                            model.

                            costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud),
                            so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.
