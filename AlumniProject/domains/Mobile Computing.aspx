                            the hand phone. About two decades ago, a hand phone was bulky and was only used
                            for voice communication. It was merely an extension of the fixed line telephony
                            that allowed users to keep in touch with colleagues. Now the hand phone is not only
                            used for voice communication, it is also used to send text and multimedia messages.
                            Future mobile devices will not only enable Internet access, but will also support
                            high-speed data services. </span>

                            M-commerce application can be classified into ten types:
                            <br />
                            1. Mobile financial application (business-to-customer [B2C] and business-to-business
                            [B2B]): The mobile device is used as a powerful financial medium.
                            <br />
                            2. Mobile advertising (B2C): It turns the wireless infrastructure and devices into

                            and B2B): It is an attempt to reduce the amount of inventory needed by managing
                            in-house and on-the-move inventory. It also includes applications that help to locate
                            products and services that are needed.

                            certain items using multicast support of wireless infrastructure.
                            <br />
                            7. Mobile entertainment services and games (B2C): It provides entertainment services
                            to users on a per-event or subscription basis.
                            <br />
                            8. Mobile office (B2C): It provides the complete office environment to mobile users
                            anywhere, anytime.
                            <br />

                            for mobile uses everywhere.
                            <br />
                            10. Wireless data center (B2C and B2B): It supports large amounts of stored data
                            to be made available to mobile users for making "intelligent" decisions. </span>
